mqtt-2-sound
============

This is a python script that connects our MQTT network at Hackspace Manchester to the audio announcements when people enter the space.

To add an announce theme for yourself (that plays when you enter the door), create an ogg file with under a second of data, and call it '''YourNickName_announce.ogg'''.  Put it in the '''audio/''' directory, and send a pull request.  Assuming tis ok, i'll pull and launch it.
